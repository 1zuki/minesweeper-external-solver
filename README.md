# Minesweeper Solver (External)

An ongoing **learning project** focused on building an external solver for the classic Minesweeper game.

The solver interacts with the game externally, maps the board state, and applies logical rules to determine safe moves and mine positions.

---

## Goals

- Learn how to:
  - Reason about incomplete information
  - Apply logical inference to real-world game states
  - Design solvers that interact with external systems
- Incrementally improve solve rate toward **95–100%**
- Explore brute-force and probability-based approaches

---

## Current Capabilities

- External board detection and mapping (100% accurate)
- Reliable board size handling
- Logical rule-based solving
- Can solve **50–75%** of simple boards without guessing

---

## Planned Improvements

- Full-board brute-force solving for hard states
- Probability-based decision making
- Improved handling of late-game guesses
- Higher solve rate (target: **95–100%**)
- Code cleanup and modularization

## Project Status

**Actively in development**

This project is primarily for learning and experimentation.
